## About Me
I am a PhD student in the Knutie Lab ((https://www.knutielab.com)), at the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, University of Connecticut.
I am interested on the effects of urbanization in the host-parasite evolutionary and ecological mechanisms in the Philornis downsi and Darwins's finches system, in the Galapagos.

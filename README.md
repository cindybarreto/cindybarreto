"PhD Student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology")
## About Me
I am a PhD student in the Knutie Lab, at the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, University of Connecticut.
I am interested on the effects of urbanization in the host-parasite evolutionary and ecological mechanisms in the Philornis downsi and Darwins's finches system, in the Galapagos.

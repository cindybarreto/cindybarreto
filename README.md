## About Me
I am a PhD student in the Knutie Lab, at the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, University of Connecticut.
I am interested on the effects of urbanization in the host-parasite evolutionary and ecological mechanisms, in the Darwin's finches and Philornis downsi system, in the Galapagos.
